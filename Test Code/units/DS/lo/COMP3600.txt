Aims to give the students an exposure to a variety of algorithms that can be used for solving real life problems. This should help them acquire necessary skills to recognize problem scenarios where such algorithms can be used, to modify an existing algorithm or develop a new one for new problems, and to show that the given problem does not lead itself to an efficient solution, if such is the case. It will also provide further experience in the development of efficient software for nontrivial purposes.
