Explain the overall objectives of the field of Algorithms and Data Structures
Identify and describe in detail a range of data structures, and searching and sorting algorithms particularly in the context of computing.
Explain each algorithm or structure, implement them in Java, and analyse their efficiency in relation to real-world problems.
Identify, describe and apply the most suitable technique to use, where there are multiple techniques that could be used.
Identify a problem in application domains, and design and implement a solution (in Java) and evaluate its performance.
