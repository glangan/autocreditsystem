At the completion of this unit, students should be able to:

analyse general problem solving strategies and algorithmic paradigms, and apply them to solving new problems;
prove correctness of programs, analyse their space and time complexities;
compare and contrast various abstract data types and use them appropriately;
develop and implement algorithms to solve computational problems.
