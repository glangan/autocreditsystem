This unit focuses on the nature of systems design, implementation and testing as phases within the systems development process. The unit develops practical skills in designing, implementing and testing desktop computer programs, focusing on ones having graphical user interfaces that communicate with data sources. Modern software tools and techniques to support designing (such as UML), programming (such as C# and pair-programming), and testing (such as use-case based testing) will be utilised. Students will explore the concepts of object-oriented modelling and programming and also Agile development methodologies. By the end of the unit, students will know the principles of how to design, implement and test a system from a requirements specification, and have the knowledge and skills required to conduct a user-centred approach to the main tasks typically required in these phases.
