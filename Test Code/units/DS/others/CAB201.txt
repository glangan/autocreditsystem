This unit introduces fundamental techniques for solving computational problems using computer programming or scripting languages. 
It describes basic programming principles and strategies and how to use them effectively. Major topics covered in the unit include:
The basic program development process (requirements definition, algorithm design, coding, testing and debugging)
Programs as calculators (expressions, variables, types and functions) Breaking (small) problems down into sequential steps (assignment, sequence and choice)
Solving (bigger) problems through repetition (loops, recursion and higher-order iterators)
Making programs fault-tolerant (input checking and exception handling)
Input and output (user interaction and accessing files)
Basic principles for showing that programs are correct (test-case design)
Basic principles of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, classes, objects, attributes and behaviours)
