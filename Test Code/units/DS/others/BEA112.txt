Financial markets play a critical role in the functioning of a modern global economy. To understand how these financial markets operate, it is important to establish the "key principles of finance" that underpin the decisions made by financial market participants, such as corporations, investors, financial institutions and governments. The ability to learn the basic principles of finance at an early stage of your degree, and the application of this understanding to financial media and "the world around you", should play an important role in building the foundations and motivation for your ongoing finance, business or economics studies. Examples and applications of the principles of finance (including in a historic context) will be provided throughout the unit that are relevant, practical and interesting, to support text book and lecture theory learning outcomes.
