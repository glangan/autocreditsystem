This unit focuses on the information needs of organisations, groups and individuals, and the ways in which ICT-based systems support them. The unit provides both a theoretical and a practical understanding of methods for evaluating the structure, policies, operations and technical capacities of organisations within their social and legal context. Students will gain an introduction to the role, knowledge and skills required of a business analyst. This unit focuses on both the specific tools and methods used by a business analyst, building on the technology learning acquired in earlier units, as well as the soft skills of creativity and communication which are critical to successful business and requirements analysis. By the end of the unit, students will understand what is involved in business analysis planning and monitoring, specifically: how to elicit and communicate organisational requirements and how to analyse and assess these requirements to enable effective business solutions.
