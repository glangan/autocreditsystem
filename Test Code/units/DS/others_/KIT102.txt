This unit will explain the relationship between data, information and knowledge and introduce a number of different methods/tools for managing, storing, securing, modelling, visualizing and analyzing. This unit will provide an understanding of how data can be manipulated to meet the needs of users. Changing data into information can be accomplished with a range of tools, including XML, SQL, spreadsheeting and data visualisation. This unit introduces the techniques to enable the students to use these tools for managing data, creating information and allowing knowledge development. Overarching the whole unit is the importance of data security and how it can be achieved. This unit concludes by introducing the concepts behind managing big data in response to global trends of capturing all available data due to inexpensive storage.
