This unit draws on the World Health Organization's Primary Health Care approach as outlined in the Alma Ata Declaration (1978), The Ottawa Charter (1986) and the Millennium Development Goals. The subject title Health Care Where People Live and Work is part of the WHO definition of Primary Health Care and is explored literally and figuratively. The unit aims to use our own health experiences and behaviours to provide the basis for enhancing understanding(s) of health concepts for integration into health promoting activities and professional practice.
