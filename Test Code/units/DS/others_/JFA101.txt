This unit provides a general introduction to the biology of aquatic animals and investigates phylogenetic relationships, and how the anatomy, physiology and life history of animals are adapted to meet their requirements for locomotion, feeding, excretion, osmoregulation, gas exchange, communication and reproduction. Students will develop practical laboratory skills in animal identification, microscopy, dissection techniques, scientific drawing and writing scientific reports.
