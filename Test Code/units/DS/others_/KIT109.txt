Games (whether they be video games, console games, computer games, mobile games, or web games) differ from
other media as they elevate the viewer to the level of a participant. Games are an ever-growing cultural phenomenon
which has increasing relevance to people's day-to-day lives and well as significant economic importance.
While games are typically "fun", they are also increasingly being developed for primarily non-entertainment uses,
such as so-called serious gaming and by the use of gamification. This unit will examine such games as they are used
to make social statements and to drive social change; for education and training; for rehabilitation and health; for
research; and for art's sake alone.
As games' cultural, societal, and economic importance grows a number of issues are increasingly drawing more
attention from the media, interest groups, and research institutions. This unit will examine controversial game
content, the effects of game playing, and various ethical concerns.
This unit will expose students to the categories and genres of games; their important features; and the techniques
used by successful games and students will get an opportunity to critically review a game of their choosing.
Additionally, students will be exposed to the basics of game development technology and game design, as well as
learning practical skills for developing games and the application of these in the development of their own small
game.
This unit will also feature local, national, and international guest speakers who will provide unique personal insights
into the workings of the games industry and advice on how to best prepare for employment within it.
