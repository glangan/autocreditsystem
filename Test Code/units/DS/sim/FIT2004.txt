This unit introduces students to problem solving concepts and 
techniques fundamental to the science of programming. 
In doing this it covers problem specification, algorithmic design, 
analysis and implementation. Detailed topics include analysis of best, 
average and worst-case time and space complexity; introduction to 
numerical algorithms; recursion; advanced data structures such as 
heaps and B-trees; hashing; sorting algorithms; searching algorithms; 
graph algorithms; and numerical computing.
