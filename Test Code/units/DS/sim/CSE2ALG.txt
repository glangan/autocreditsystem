This subject covers a range of important algorithms and data structures. Data structures for implementing containers are covered and include linear structures, tree structures and hash tables. Algorithms for insertion and deletion of elements, and algorithms for searching and sorting on these structures are covered where appropriate. Graphs and graph algorithms are also covered. Students will learn the construction and workings of the data structures and algorithms covered. They will learn to analyse the effectiveness of each data structure and algorithm for specific problems and categories of problems. Students will also implement in programs a wide range of the structures and algorithms covered.
