This unit introduces students to fundamental data structures and algorithms used in computing. The material covered forms the basis for further studies in programming and software engineering in later units and for further training in programming skills. The unit focuses on the ideas of data abstraction and algorithm efficiency. The issues of computational complexity of algorithms are addressed throughout the semester. The topics covered include the fundamental abstract data types (lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables, graphs), recursion, complexity of algorithms, sorting and searching algorithms, binary search trees and graphs.
