This course addresses various data structures and techniques for algorithm design and analysis. It covers basic data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, trees and graphs within an Object paradigm. The design of various algorithms such as searching algorithms, sorting algorithms and graph algorithms is discussed. This course also addresses other topics such as recursive algorithms and complexity analysis.
