 This unit extends the study of object-oriented programming by introducing the major data structures and algorithms used in programming including arrays, lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, graphs, recursion, searching, sorting, a review pre-built data structures and algorithms provided by system libraries, and library documentation. Upon completion of this unit, students will have an understanding of data structures and algorithms and their role in software development, and be able to implement them.
