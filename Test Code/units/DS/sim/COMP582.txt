This unit introduces fundamental data structures, their implementation and use in efficient program solving in C++. Theory and implementation aspects are treated. Relations between the choice of structure and of algorithm are emphasised. Topics include: linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables, sorting and searching, recursive algorithms, and analysis of time and space complexity.
