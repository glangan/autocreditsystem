This unit extends the first year treatment in KIT107 of standard data 
structures and algorithms for solving
computational problems. 
Topics include: data structures (such as balanced trees and hash tables) 
for collections,
(binary heaps for) priority queues, sorting algorithms 
(e.g. heapsort, mergesort and quicksort), graphs and graph 
algorithms 
(e.g. for searching, topological sorting, critical path analysis, 
shortest paths, minimum spanning trees,
network flow), 
pattern finding (for substrings and regular expressions), 
algorithmic problem solving and algorithm
design techniques 
(e.g. greed, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, backtracking).
