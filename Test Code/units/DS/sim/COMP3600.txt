This course deals with the study of algorithms for solving practical problems, and of the data structures used in algorithm implementations. Detailed analysis of the resource requirements of algorithms will be an important issue.
The topics covered will include: mathematical tools, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, divide-and-conquer, data structures (hash tables, binary search trees, red-black trees, and disjoint sets), basic search techniques (breadth-first search and depth-first search), graph algorithms (topo-logical sort, minimum spanning trees and single-source and all-to-all shortest paths), etc.
