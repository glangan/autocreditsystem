Students who succeed in all aspects of this course will be able to:
describe and contrast various algorithmic components, and relate them to specific corresponding data structures.
analyse program fragments and explain their types, behaviours and effects.
design algorithmic solutions to simple problems and present their implementation in a functional programming language.
design data structures appropriate for the representation and implementation of simple algorithmic problems.
analyse small programming problems to suggest, design and implement appropriate modular program structures, based on a data-directed approach.
