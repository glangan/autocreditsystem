This unit introduces the topic of game design. Students will work in teams to design and document a game and develop a simple prototype of their design using an agile development methodology. Design topics that will be covered include concept development, world design, character and story design, gameplay and game mechanics, user interface design, balancing and testing. In addition, students will learn skills that are essential for the game designer, such as 3D modelling, using level editing tools, and scripting.
