By its nature, computation is close to mathematics. This unit examines some of the mathematical processes that underlie the science and technology that has been enabled by the computer age, with emphasis on applications using Python. This provides a treatment of discrete mathematics to support the programs of students taking a first course in Computer Science or planning to study areas of advanced mathematics such as Algebra, Number Theory and Probability. Skills developed are also useful for careers in Operations Research, Engineering, Management, Finance, Economics and Teaching.
