Introduces the basic principles of programming using a block-structured procedural programming language in a command-line environment. Students will gain a thorough theoretical and practical understanding of the programming process, including the ability to write and debug structured programs, stepwise refine code, use top-down development, develop appropriate algorithms and write modularised code using blocks and functions. Emphasis in the unit is at all times on a sound understanding of the principles involved, with particular attention being paid to worked examples to demonstrate these principles in a clear and straightforward fashion.
