This unit is an introductory computer science unit, 
providing a practical introduction to basic computing and 
programming concepts. Students gain an understanding of,
 and practical experience in, computer programming; 
practical experience in implementing informal prose 
descriptions of problem solutions using an imperative language; 
an understanding of, and practical experience in, designing, 
coding, testing and debugging simple algorithms; and 
an understanding of the principle of incremental development. 
Other topics include: the concept of program correctness; the 
differences between high-level languages, assembly languages
 and machine languages; the role played by compilers; and the
 execution of programs by computer hardware.
