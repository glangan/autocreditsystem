This unit will provide students with an overview of the fundamentals 
required to create programs. Students will learn to develop descriptions 
of algorithms and program logic using pseudocode which will be implemented 
as working software programs using a visual procedural programming language. 
The unit will explore a variety of application domains including: 
computer games, business and science applications, computer generated arts, 
computer-based simulations and the control of simple robots. 
The topics covered will include the fundamental concepts: 
data types and structures, basic types of input and output, 
program control structures, and modular design along with the basics of 
event-driven programming and objects. These topics will be covered while 
placing an emphasis on the need to design program code that is easy to 
maintain, readable, tested, and well documented.
