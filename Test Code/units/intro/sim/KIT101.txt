This unit will provide students with an overview of programming and 
its role in problem-solving, and strategies for designing solutions to 
programming problems. Beginning with the fundamental characteristics of 
computers and how they represent information, the unit will develop the 
concepts of data types, declarations (of the data a program will use), 
expressions (calculations) and statements (actions). Building on these 
low-level constructs the unit will examine ways to manage the complexity 
in a program with control structures, block structure, methods (functions) 
and their parameters, culminating in the high-level organisational mechanisms 
of classes and objects. More advanced topics such as error handling using 
exceptions, basic graphical user interface design and construction, and 
text-based input and output will also be covered. The 
Java programming language will be used.
